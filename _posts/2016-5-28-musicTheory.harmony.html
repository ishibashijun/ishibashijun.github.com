<p>Studied a little of music theory. These are my notes.</p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>DT</b> is constructed with Major 3rd which is followed by minor 3rd that is followed by minor 3rd. For example, G7 on C Major scale.</li>
    <li><b>D'</b> is Seventh Chord that is not DT.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dissonance</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>D'</b> must contains a tone which is consonance of the chord before it.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Resolution</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Need to go one up or down diatonically (most likely downward).</li>
            <li><b>DT</b> and <b>D'</b> 7th must go downward diatonically which is consonance of the chord after it.</li>
            <li><i>IV</i> 7th must become 3rd of the chord after it by go upward diatonically.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Cadence</h2>
<ul>
    <li><h4>Perfect Cadence</h4> - <i>V</i> to <i>I</i>.</li>
    <li><h4>Imperfect Cadence</h4> - Inverted <i>V</i> to <i>I</i> and <i>V</i> to inverted <i>I</i>.</li>
    <li><h4>Half Cadence</h4> - Ends with <i>V</i>.</li>
    <li><h4>Pragal Cadence</h4> - <i>IV</i> to <i>I</i>.</li>
    <li><h4>Interrupted Cadence</h4> - <i>V</i> to <i>VI</i> and <i>V</i> to <i>III</i>.</li>
    <li><h4>Faure Cadence</h4> - <i>IV</i> to <i>V</i>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Base key and 3rd can not be omitted.</li>
    <li>Every triads, base key, 3rd and 5th can not be omitted.</li>
    <li>Every seventh and nineth chord can omit 5th.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rules of bass</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tonic and <b>DT</b> must contains a tone before it(common tone).</li>
    <li><b>D'</b> must contains a tone which is consonance of the chord before it.</li>
    <li><i>IV</i> must contains more than a consonance tone from one before.</li>
    <li><b>D'</b> and <b>DT</b> must go downward 5. In <b>D'</b>, next chord must be <i>V</i>.</li>
    <li><i>IV</i> must go up 4 diatonically. In next chord, base tone must be <i>I</i> or <b>DT</b> or <i>IV</i>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rules of treble</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If 7th tone is in treble, a tone before must be also a same tone.</li>
    <li>If bass is <b>DT</b> or <b>D'</b> and 7th tone is in treble, it must go downward diatonically, but if bass is <i>IV</i> and 7th tone is in treble, it must go upward diatonically.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rules of melody of bass</h2>
<ul>
    <li><i>VII</i> must go upward diatonically.</li>
    <li>F, F#, G, G#, A, A# and B must go downward diatonically.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rules of single tone melody</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Avoid going augmented 4.</li>
    <li>Avoid going Major and minor 7.</li>
    <li>Avoid going more than one octave.</li>
    <li><i>VII</i> must go <i>I</i>.</li>
    <li>Avoid sequence of jumping progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rules of 2 tones melody</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Avoid perfect 5 to perfect 5, Major 5 to perfect 5 and minor 5 to perfect 5.</li>
    <li>Avoid perfect 8 to perfect 8.</li>
    <li>Avoid perfect 1 to perfect 1.</li>
    <li>Avoid double <i>VII</i>.</li>
    <li>Avoid going parallel perfect 5 and 8.</li>
    <li>In treble and bass, avoid jumping to parallel perfect 5 and 8 with high treble and low bass.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Triads</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Base, 3rd and 5th of <i>I</i> can be doubled.</li>
    <li>Let ring a common tone on progress of <i>I</i> to <i>V</i> and <i>I</i> to <i>IV</i>.</li>
    <li>In the end of a song 5th can be omitted.</li>
    <li>3rd of <i>V</i> can not be doubled.</li>
    <li>Base, 3rd and 5th of <i>IV</i> can be doubled.</li>
    <li>Base, 3rd and 5th of <i>II</i> can be doubled.</li>
    <li>Let ring a common tone on progress of <i>II</i> to <i>VI</i>.</li>
    <li>Base, 3rd and 5th of <i>VI</i> can be doubled.</li>
    <li>Base, 3rd and 5th of <i>III</i> can be doubled, but avoid doubling 5th without inversion.</li>
    <li>Basic style and 2nd inversion of <i>VII</i> can double 3rd.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Seventh Chord</h2>
<ul>
    <li><i>V</i>7, 3rd must go up one and 7th go down 1 diatonically.</li>
    <li>In the end of a song, <i>V</i>7, 3rd can go down 3 diatonically.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nineth Chord</h2>
<ul>
    <li><i>V</i>9, 9th must be 8 diatonically above from base tone.</li>
    <li><i>V</i>9 aug, 9th must be above 3rd.</li>
    <li>9th must go down 1 diatonically to be resolved.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Modulation</h2>
<ul>
    <li><h4>Phrase Modulation</h4> - A scale ends with cadense in a section then continue to another.</li>
    <li><h4>Common-chord Modulation</h4> - Scales share some chords in a section then a scale changes to another.</li>
    <li><h4>Enharmonic Modulation</h4> - Change <i>V</i>7 to augmented 6 or diminished 7 to same chord but different scale.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nonharmonic Tones</h2>
<ul>
    <li><h4>Passing Tone</h4> - A chord's tone go up or down 1 diatonically then on same direction go 1 diatonically.<li>
    <li><h4>Neighbor Tone</h4> - A chord's tone go up or down 1 diatonically then go back to same tone with same or another chord.</li>
    <li><h4>Suspension</h4> - Letting ring one or more tones of the chord to another chord which becomes nonharmonic then go up or down 1 diatonically to another chord's tone.</li>
    <li><h4>Appoggiatura</h4> - Accented nonharmonic tone, go up or down 1 diatonically to becomes harmonic.</li>
    <li><h4>Escape Tone</h4> - go up or down 1 diatonically then on opposite direction go 2 diatonically.</li>
    <li><h4>Anticipation</h4> - go up or down 1 diatonically to become a tone of the following chord.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rules of Nonharmonic Tones</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A resolution tone can not be above an nonharmonic tone.</li>
    <li>Interval of resolution and nonharmonic tone can not be 1 diatonically.</li>
    <li>Parallel interval of resolution and nonharmonic tone can not be 8 diatonically.</li>
</ul>
